h1. Director Class

This is a fork of the "Director class":http://developer.anscamobile.com/forums/director-class created by "Ricardo Rauber":http://twitter.com/rauberlabs for Ansca's Corona SDK. It includes useful extensions developed by "Josh Tynjala":http://twitter.com/joshtynjala. This fork is currently based on version 1.2.

h2. addParamsForModule()

The @addParamsForModule()@ function allows the Director class to pass a parameters object to a module's @new()@ function when changing scenes. Rather than polluting the global namespace, you can use this function to inject data into screens when Director displays them.

bc.. local settingsData = { soundsEnabled = true }
director:addParamsForModule("settings", settingsData)
director:addParamsForModule("game", settingsData)
director:changeScene("settings", "moveFromLeft")

p. In the code above, both the settings screen and the game itself can share the same object for settings data, and they can access it without using a global variable.

Using Director's scene template as a basis, here's how you might access the parameters that are passed to @new()@:

bc.. module(..., package.seeall)
local localGroup = display.newGroup()
function new(params)

	if params.soundsEnabled then
		-- do something
	end

	return localGroup
end
